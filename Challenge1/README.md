# Setup

Using Python Pandas to clean and transform an anonymized version of a dataset.

Tasks to achieve this include:
- Importing & Loading csv data into Python
- Dropping NaN values from DataFrame
- Creating new DataFrames
- Creating, Renaming & Dropping columns & column values
- Slicing & Merging DataFrames

Note: In this case, some NaN values have been dropped to run the code but in certain situation this may cause incorrect reports if validated against the source data.
